# TODO

- Build out the app assuming the Goods database is up-to-date (it's not)
- Figure out how to copy the up-to-date database file from my register
  - Preferably:
    - At-will
    - From within this app
    - Without installing anything on the register

- Need to keep track of when last pull from real database happened.
